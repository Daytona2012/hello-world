# hello-world
This is just a Test for hello world.  Will the world say hello back?
I'm new to programming and find it very addictive. Tho it seems programming is old, we are still on the beach with an ocean of knowledge and technology still to be discovered. Its like your on a tight rope without any safety net when u code, bt when u fall off u dont neccessarily die, but instead u discover something else.
